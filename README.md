## **Architecture**  
The chatbot follows a modular **RAG-based** architecture:  

1️⃣ **Data Ingestion**: Collects structured/unstructured health data from trusted sources.  
2️⃣ **Vector Database Storage**: Stores embeddings for fast and efficient retrieval.  
3️⃣ **Query Processing**: Maps user inputs to medical context and retrieves relevant data.  
4️⃣ **LLM Response Generation**: Generates conversational responses based on retrieved medical insights.  
5️⃣ **Doctor Recommendation System**: Uses ML-based symptom classification for personalized recommendations.  
6️⃣ **Reminder System**: Notifies users about medications, appointments, and health checkups.
